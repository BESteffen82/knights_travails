# Knights Travails

This project was created as part of The Odin Project curriculum. This program implements a function that shows the shortest possible way for a knight on an 8 x 8 chess board to get from one square to another by outputting all the squares the knight will stop on along the way.

The function uses Breadth First Search and a FIFO queue to determine the shortest path that would be taken by the knight.
